                ELECTRONIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION
              </h4>
              <p>
                When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to
                register your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge
                your registration information with any information you've
                already left with us (we call that information your personal
                profile). If you haven't previously registered with us, we
                create a personal profile for you from your product registration
                information. If you ever want to review or update that
                information, you can visit the Profile Center, click on Update
                Profile, and edit any of the Personal Information in your
                profile. If you haven't already created a Registration ID, we
                will ask you to do so. This ensures that only you can access
                your information.
              </p>
              <h4>CUSTOMER PROFILES</h4>
              <p>
                As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique
                personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal
                identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can
                access your profile.

              <p>
                When you register, we create your profile, assign a personal
                identification number, then send this personal identification
                number back to your hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is
                a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours. It is
                your passport to seamless travel across LIVESTOCK LOADER
                allowing you to download free software, order free newsletters,
                and visit premium sites without having to fill out registration
                forms with information you've already provided. Even if you
                switch computers, you won't have to re-register – just use your
                Registration ID to identify yourself.

              <h4>WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION YOU SHARE</h4>
              <p>
                When you join us, you provide us with your contact information,
                including Melanie Plitt and email address. We use this
                information to send you updates about your order, questionnaires
                to measure your satisfaction with our service and announcements
                about new and exciting services that we offer. When you order
                from us, we ask for your credit card number and billing address.
                We use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you
                order at that time. For your convenience, we do save billing
                information in case you want to order from us again, but we
                don't use this information again without your permission.
              </p>
              <p>
                We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services
                on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering
                purchases, answering customer questions about products or
                services, sending postal mail and processing event registration.
                We will only provide those companies the information they need
                to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that
                information for any other purpose.
              </p>
              <p>
                LIVESTOCK LOADER will disclose your personal information,

                faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to
                the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on
